(ESN)

\section{Data}

\subsection*{MIDI-File}

\subsection*{Generation}

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Pre-processing}

- convert midi file into csv using https://www.fourmilab.ch/webtools/midicsv/ 

- parse csv into a signal where the length represents the duration
of the midi file. Each element is a vector of length max amount of
nodes and each value of this vector represents the intensity / 0/1
(testing) 

- generation which contains the same properties of the signals, but
it is generated instead of using midi files. 

\subsection{Echo State Network}

In this music generating task an ESN is used. The input signal of
the ESN is created as described in the pre-prosessing. The set up
of this ESN is based on `` GUIDE REFERECE ``. The following parameters
of the ESN have been set:

\subsubsection*{The resevoir size}

Within ESNs, it is serverly important that the resevoir is big enough,
such that is it possible to obtain the target output $y^{target}(n)$
from a linear combination of this signal space. The resevoir in this
project has been set to ... because ....

\subsubsection*{The resevoir density }

The density of a resevoir is mainly dependent on the distribution
of the nonzero elements in the resevoir. In this project a basic uniform
distribution is used. Besides the distribution, the density of the
resevoir is set to .... because ....

\subsubsection*{Spectral radius}

The spectral radius = param / max eigenval but we start with a random
one 

\subsubsection*{Leaking rate}

Ridge regression (parameter). Transformer (?). Output

\subsection{Post-processing}

\subsection{Fitting}

evaluation function (MLP/Jaeger idea). expanding parameters: bfs with
gradient decent.
